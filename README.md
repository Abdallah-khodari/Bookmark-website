This is a simple Website Bookmark Manager application built with JavaScript. It allows users to add, display, visit, and delete website bookmarks, which are stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage.

Features
Add Website: Users can add website names and URLs.
Visit Website: Users can click a "Visit" button to open the website in a new tab.
Delete Website: Users can delete websites from the list, and the change is saved to local storage.
Validation: Ensures that the site name contains at least 3 characters and the URL is valid.
Local Storage: All website data is stored in the browser's localStorage so it persists across page reloads.

HTML5: For the basic structure of the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the webpage and elements.
